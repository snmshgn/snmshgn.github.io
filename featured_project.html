        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>A client came to us with an idea for a cloud storage application and we designed one for musicians in an effort to alleviate the stress points of long distance collaboration. Our role was to create a brand, design a product and test it with users.</p>
        <p>Using Figma, Sketch, Invision, Maze and Google Forms, we researched, designed and built prototypes for our users, testing and retesting to create an intuitive and seamless experience.</p>

      <article class = "right problem p-right">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Our client came to us with a vague idea of a cloud storage application with a few features in mind; sharing, saving content, creating content, and organizing content in some way . With such a wide range of paths available, it fell to us to research a user base, create a brand, design a product, and test it out. We were responsible for everything from UX Research to Information Hierarchy to Prototype creation and polishing.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "left solution">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Our solution was a collaboration app for music engineers. Our research showed stress points in long distance work between different kinds of creators and a need for an online control center for their tracks. We created a style guide, as shown at the beginning of this paper, deliverables such as font styling for branding and descriptive text, hi fidelity mockups of screen views, images and icons.</p>

        <h3>Client Brief</h3>
        <ul class="primary-ul">
          <li>A cloud-based storage app.</li>
          <li>Saving content you find on the web. (links, images, videos, etc.)</li>
          <li>Organizing content using thinks like folders, tags, categories, and/or groups.</li>
          <li>Creating content. (notes, documents, maybe spreadsheets?)</li>
          <li>Uploading files from a computer or mobile device.</li>
          <li>Collaboration features that allow:
            <ul class="secondary-ul">
              <li>Sharing a single item with someone else.</li>
              <li>Sharing a group or folder with someone else.</li>
              <li>Connecting with other users for real time collaboration in notes or documents.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The client made clear that they had no clear vision for the project, and that the above features were things they would like to include, but were more of a guideline of core strengths they wanted the product to play towards.</p>
        <p>To get a better idea of what we could accomplish, we created a list of possible uses for cloud and what we might need for a successful project. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yqunmqQ8zWoodOZJNb4jAqiCUatWdChjG40rdSh-TEA/edit" target="_blank">[Client Brief]</a></p>

        <h3>Surveys</h3>
        <p>To get a better idea of how potential users might respond to the client’s proposed features, we launched a survey using Google Forms. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/DIlWaAxLNWvOS5S23" target="_blank">[The Survey]</a> We wanted to learn more on these main points:</p>
          <ul class="primary-ul">
            <li>How many people actually use cloud storage.</li>
            <li>What do they use it for.</li>
            <li>What services do they already use.</li>
            <li>If and why they might use multiple services.</li>
            <li>And finally, what issues they have with the services they are using.</li>
          </ul>
      </article>
      <img class="imgsurveys1" src="/" alt="Survey Example"> <!-- Image content needs to be created and added later, probably through CSS -->
      <article class = "left surveys-pt2">
        <p>Using social media, personal networks and the slack platform, we distributed the survey and got the following results:</p>
          <ul class="primary-ul">
            <li>Most survey takers use more than one cloud service due to different specialties of those products. (i.e. Pinterest for imagery, GoogleDrive for documents, etc.)</li>
            <li>Users were most likely to create an account for personal use and/or work related activities.</li>
            <li>95% of survey takers were interested in a file sharing feature, 90% in file uploading, and 65% in real time collaboration.</li>
            <li>85% preferred to be able to access their content across multiple devices.</li>
            <li>65% interested in sharing capabilities preferred to share through link generation.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Based on the survey results, we concluded that a minimum viable product would need to have sharing capabilities (most likely through link generation), content uploading, real time collaboration syncing and be accessible across both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

      <article class = "right com-analysis p-right">
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>Based on the results of our survey, we created a SWOT analysis of our three main competitors to find weaknesses, strengths, opportunities and threats within their marketing, navigation and ease of use. In order to have a wide range of service types to dissect, we chose GoogleDrive, iCloud, and Pinterest. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yqUPF8EKLCvAt7hqBnG_RrMcYgQEWSbstNNpq3uZoFc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[Competitive Analysis]</a></p>
        <p>Analysis provided insight into market targeting techniques, how we could make our product superior through design, information hierarchy, and features, and which competitors posed the largest threat to our proposed project.</p>

        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>Following up on survey takers with quick informal interviews helped with the creation of personas, a kind of generalized theoretical user that represents different groups of potential users. We maintained two types of groupings for users with different goals to help streamline our design process and make sure we were thinking user first at all times.</p>

        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <p>In order to find what was necessary for our MVP, we created a list of tasks that users would be able to accomplish and ranked them according to necessity. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EkBnXpkmps3Mo795NKQZ1YNNz3Ln3gY90qLrdXcg3KY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[User Stories]</a></p>

      <article class = "left flows">
        <h3>User Flows & Sitemap</h3>
        <p>We created flow charts for paths that users would need to take in order to accomplish the tasks in the User Stories. This would also include multiple paths to the same destination, if applicable. <a href="https://app.flowmapp.com/share/60a7f80a3c60255022c63cfbb5ea2cf0/userflow/4897" target="_blank">[User Flows]</a></p>
        <p>Using that, we created a site map to show what screens needed to be designed. <a href="https://app.flowmapp.com/share/60a7f80a3c60255022c63cfbb5ea2cf0" target="_blank">[Sitemap]</a></p>

      <article class = "right wireframes1 p-right">
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Using the sitemap, we began to create iterations of wireframes first on paper, then, once we decided on final drafts, digitally. It was during the digital wireframing creation that we came to the realization that the product we proposed was too generalized to be successful within the market. We went back through our survey results, looked at our interviews, and found a niche audience in musicians.</p>

      <img class="wireframes-pt1" src="/" alt="Wireframes"><!-- Image content needs to be created and added later, probably through CSS. -->
      <article class = "left surveys-rd2">
        <h3>User Surveys, Round 2</h3>
        <p>A second survey was launched through Google Forms, spread through the musicians we had already interviewed in the first round of research. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kE3VRyu00FCcIoQo1" target="_blank">[Second Survey]</a></p>
        <p>Keeping the first survey’s results in mind, we focused more on the niche audience we were hoping to target to find stress points in their work process. What we got back was that musicians using cloud services to store or share their work had the most issues with collaborating lost distance with other musicians. The features they were interested in lined up with the features ranked highest in the general survey, namely uploading content, collaborating, and sharing.</p>

      <article class = "right comp-analysis2 p-right">
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>We found that we only really had a single potential competitor within the market, Splice. We did a SWOT analysis of their product as well, finding patterns and weaknesses that could be used in informing our own designs.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "left wireframes2">
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>We went back to the wireframes and sketched out more ideas. Once we settled on an idea, we proceeded to create the low fidelity mockups to figure out where exactly to place content, how to size it and how to create an intuitive experience for the user.</p>
      </article>
      <img class="wireframes-pt2" src="/" alt="Round 2 Wireframes"><!-- Image content needs to be created and added later, probably through CSS. -->
      <article class = "right prototyping p-right">
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>We created a prototype using the low fidelity mockups, testing them with potential users to find flaws in the design. The initial design was clunky and didn’t allow users to view all parts of the track they had uploaded. Taking their considerations into account, we redesigned and retested.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "left branding">
        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>Part of our work for the client was creating a brand for the product, something users would see and feel connected to. Working off our revamped user personas, we decided the brand should portray key ideals of creativity, modern design and easy use.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "right colors p-right">
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <p>A first step to take was the color pallete. Going on our descriptives, we chose colors that invoked those emotions in potential users. Using color theory, we chose the following:</p>
      </article>
      <img class="imgcolors" src="/" alt="Colors"><!-- Image content needs to be created and added later, probably through CSS. -->
      <article class = "right colorspt2 p-right">
        <p>The choices selected for the branding of this project reflect the attitude of the product itself. It gives an edgy, bold and energetic brand that our target demographic, young collaborating musicians, will feel connected to. The music industry is an electric field, full of energy and sound and sensation. The colors chosen for our palette help reflect that.</p>
        <p>The calming dark blues of the background give a sense of calm and trustworthiness to us, while the accents of bright reddish orange bring an energy and urgency to the pages. We also have an accent of sage green in two different tones to create a grounded feeling for links and buttons that have already been used. The two off whites are derived from yellow, lending more of a bright tone to offset the dark background.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "left typography">
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>To work with these colors, and to continue with the theme of energy and creativity, we chose a bold font for headings and brand type; Montserrat ExtraBold, with -10% kerning and a 58% line height to push the letters closer together and create a graphic feel.</p>
        <p>For the font that would be more widely used in text blocks, we chose Lato Light, a type that echoed the modern geometric feel of Montserrat, but with a far lighter weight. We chose a 2% kerning and a 110% line height to make the text easily readable.</p>
      </article>
      <img class="styleguide" src="/" alt="Style Guide"><!-- Image content needs to be created and added later, probably through CSS. -->
      <article class = "right logo p-right">
        <h3>Logo</h3>
        <p>We decided that the name of the product should reflect how it was designed, as an essential resource. Settling on the name Esse, we sketched out ideas. Eventually we settled on a split view text logo using our heading font of Montserrat.</p>
        <p>The color pattern would changed based on the background, allowing for a wide range of color combinations still within our palette</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "left hifimockups">
        <h3>Hi Fidelity Mockups & Prototype Testing</h3>
        <p>Using the branding and color scheme, we proceeded to the hi fidelity mockups and testing. We created designs for both desktop and mobile, testing both until our results came back with more intuitive navigation by users.</p>
        <p>What we learned from our rounds of testing were this:</p>
          <ul class="primary-ul">
            <li>Users needed more color cues in their navigational direction.</li>
            <li>Where the desktop app was more understandable and wordy, the mobile app provided some limitations in what users could do, which in turn limited the translation of the design to mobile, as well as redesigned the action buttons into icons on a taskbar at the bottom of the screen.</li>
          </ul>
      </article>
      <article class = "right conclusion p-right">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The biggest takeaway from this project was the ability and necessity to go back and review our work at every step, to think of the viability of the product and continue to generate new solutions. Pre-user survey research was found to be key as well. This would eliminate generalized thinking going forward and allow for more focused work and questions for testers.</p>
        <p>The biggest doubt going into the project was the client brief itself. It was very vague, with almost no information on what exactly we ought to be making. There was no target audience, no clear idea of what kind of product we wanted other than a cloud based storage app, and no research on the client’s part for unique features and attributes. While this gave us a lot of options to pursue, it also put most of the work on the research team, relying on them to answer all the basic questions the client should have had some kind of idea of. The first read of the brief felt like the idea itself wasn’t viable without more work.</p>
        <p>The biggest surprise was the different paths users found to accomplish a task. They opened new ways of thinking of navigation for us, and taught us that it is important to allow for multiple paths through a product.</p>
        <p>Had we been given more time, we would have done far more research and testing on a larger audience. Finding musicians to test was difficult in the short period we were given and we would have benefitted from a larger base of testers.</p>
        <p>The lessons learned in this project will carry with us through future designs, reminding us the importance of initial research and informal information for concept ideas.</p>
