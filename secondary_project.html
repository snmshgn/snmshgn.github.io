        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Overview</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Tasked with creating an app from conception to design, I thought back on the problems I'd like to solve for myself. I decided that, as an avid reader, a recommendation app is the direction I wanted to go.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "right problem p-right">
        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Problem</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The question I wanted to answer was this: Is there a better way to find your next book to read?</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I had always had some trouble finding books that covered overarching themes that I was interested in, and often those themes were not concentrated within a specific genre, which meant trying to find them became a guessing game of sorts. I asked this same question of my users during the research phase, finding that, yes, many people faced the same problem.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "left solution">
        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Solution</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I decided to create Thematic, an app that allows a user to search for books based on genre, theme, or any cross-section of the two. It gives users information on what themes each book covers and has a recommendation feature based on previous books read, explicitly focusing on common themes relating to higher ratings.</p>

        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">User Research</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Since I had chosen a concept that I myself had experience with, I chose to use that to inform my questions for user surveys and conversations with users on what kinds of things frustrated them, what they wanted, what they needed.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Users tended to fall into three categories:</p>
        <ul class="primary-ul animated nowHidden">
          <li>Users who were specifically looking for inclusive storytelling,</li>
          <li>users who were most concerned with the quality of writing, and</li>
          <li>users who were more interested in what themes a book covered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The most important common feature was the presence of other user reviews on a book. The most common frustration with existing products is the lack of a specified search option.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The user survey part of the process revealed that, unlike myself, most users did not consider themes to be more important than the genre they were currently reading. In fact, it was rather split in the middle, with 1/3 saying it didn’t matter more, 1/3 saying it sometimes did, and a final 1/3 saying that it mattered more.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "right surveys-pt1 p-right" id="uxresearch">
        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Our biggest competitor is GoodReads, but others included non traditional search rituals through amazon, google, wattpad, tumblr, twitter and other social networks. </p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">While GoodReads markets itself specifically to book readers, others, such as Amazon Books, are a small part of a larger online commerce site, focused less on the user’s interest in which books they want to read, and more on what they should buy, which isn’t always the same thing. </p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I found two other competitors for the analysis, one of which I myself often used, and another that was new, but posed intriguing marketing for users. The first is BookRiot, a site dedicated to articles and news about books. It’s more of a blog than a recommendation site, but it’s a place I often start when searching, which made me think others might as well. The downside to BookRiot is the fact that they are articles, and not more specified information on specific books. </p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The second I found is called TBR: Tailored Book Recommendations. It markets itself as the StitchFix for bibliophiles. A read person reviews your answers to a quick survey, and sends you personally tailored recommendations based on those answers once a month or so. While the idea of this is very interesting, the downside is that it is a paid service, and that it sends a rather small selection of books to the user.</p>

      <article class = "left surveys-pt2">
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I figured a competitor had a chance to break into this market. The competition was rather sparse and divided, and there was an opportunity to create room by integrating some of their features into a new product.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Using this information, I developed a base idea for what my initial product would contain: The ability to search in specific ways, the ability to create and view user reviews, the ability to cross reference genres and themes, and to have a specified recommendation page working on the history of the user’s ratings and common threads.</p>

It was during the digital wireframing creation that we came to the realization that the product we proposed was too generalized to be successful within the market. We went back through our survey results, looked at our interviews, and found a niche audience in musicians.</p>

        <p class="animated nowHidden">Keeping the first survey’s results in mind, we focused more on the niche audience we were hoping to target to find stress points in their work process. What we got back was that musicians using cloud services to store or share their work had the most issues with collaborating lost distance with other musicians. The features they were interested in lined up with the features ranked highest in the general survey, namely uploading content, collaborating, and sharing.</p>

      <article class = "left conclusion">
        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden"><b><i>The biggest takeaway from this project was the ability and necessity to go back and review our work at every step, to think of the viability of the product and continue to generate new solutions.</i></b></p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Pre-user survey research was found to be key as well. This would eliminate generalized thinking going forward and allow for more focused work and questions for testers.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The biggest doubt going into the project was the client brief itself. It was very vague, with almost no information on what exactly we ought to be making. There was no target audience, no clear idea of what kind of product we wanted other than a cloud based storage app, and no research on the client’s part for unique features and attributes. While this gave us a lot of options to pursue, it also put most of the work on the research team, relying on them to answer all the basic questions the client should have had some kind of idea of. The first read of the brief felt like the idea itself wasn’t viable without more work.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The biggest surprise was the different paths users found to accomplish a task. They opened new ways of thinking of navigation for us, and taught us that it is important to allow for multiple paths through a product.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Had we been given more time, we would have done far more research and testing on a larger audience. Finding musicians to test was difficult in the short period we were given and we would have benefitted from a larger base of testers.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The lessons learned in this project will carry with us through future designs, reminding us the importance of initial research and informal information for concept ideas.</p>
