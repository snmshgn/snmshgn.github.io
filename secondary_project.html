        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Overview</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Tasked with creating an app from conception to design, I thought back on the problems I'd like to solve for myself. I decided that, as an avid reader, a recommendation app is the direction I wanted to go.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "right problem p-right">
        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Problem</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The question I wanted to answer was this: <b><i>Is there a better way to find your next book to read?</b></i></p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I had always had some trouble finding books that covered overarching themes that I was interested in, and often those themes were not concentrated within a specific genre, which meant trying to find them became a guessing game of sorts. I asked this same question of my users during the research phase, finding that, yes, many people faced the same problem.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "left solution">
        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Solution</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I decided to create Thematic, an app that allows a user to search for books based on genre, theme, or any cross-section of the two. It gives users information on what themes each book covers and has a recommendation feature based on previous books read, explicitly focusing on common themes relating to higher ratings.</p>

        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">User Research</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Since I had chosen a concept that I myself had experience with, I chose to use that to inform my questions for user surveys and conversations with users on what kinds of things frustrated them, what they wanted, what they needed.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Users tended to fall into three categories:</p>
        <ul class="primary-ul animated nowHidden">
          <li>Users who were specifically looking for inclusive storytelling,</li>
          <li>users who were most concerned with the quality of writing, and</li>
          <li>users who were more interested in what themes a book covered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The most important common feature was the presence of other user reviews on a book. The most common frustration with existing products is the lack of a specified search option.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The user survey part of the process revealed that, unlike myself, most users did not consider themes to be more important than the genre they were currently reading. In fact, it was rather split in the middle, with 1/3 saying it didn’t matter more, 1/3 saying it sometimes did, and a final 1/3 saying that it mattered more.</p>
      </article>
      <article class = "right surveys-pt1 p-right" id="uxresearch">
        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Our biggest competitor is GoodReads, but others included non traditional search rituals through amazon, google, wattpad, tumblr, twitter and other social networks. </p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">While GoodReads markets itself specifically to book readers, others, such as Amazon Books, are a small part of a larger online commerce site, focused less on the user’s interest in which books they want to read, and more on what they should buy, which isn’t always the same thing. </p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I found two other competitors for the analysis, one of which I myself often used, and another that was new, but posed intriguing marketing for users. The first is BookRiot, a site dedicated to articles and news about books. It’s more of a blog than a recommendation site, but it’s a place I often start when searching, which made me think others might as well. The downside to BookRiot is the fact that they are articles, and not more specified information on specific books. </p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The second I found is called TBR: Tailored Book Recommendations. It markets itself as the StitchFix for bibliophiles. A read person reviews your answers to a quick survey, and sends you personally tailored recommendations based on those answers once a month or so. While the idea of this is very interesting, the downside is that it is a paid service, and that it sends a rather small selection of books to the user.</p>

      <article class = "left surveys-pt2">
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I figured a competitor had a chance to break into this market. The competition was rather sparse and divided, and there was an opportunity to create room by integrating some of their features into a new product.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Using this information, I developed a base idea for what my initial product would contain: The ability to search in specific ways, the ability to create and view user reviews, the ability to cross reference genres and themes, and to have a specified recommendation page working on the history of the user’s ratings and common threads.</p>

        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">User Flows & Sitemap</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">User flows were created with the user in mind, attempting to create sectional areas of the app that users could use for specific purposes. I faced some difficulty in breaking down the user flows to make them more legible, but kept the master file for it in tact as a guide for how all the disparate parts connect.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">Even as I was creating the user flows, I knew there would be changes made to how content might be accessed. Given more time, I would have happily fleshed out the user stories more and added those to the user flows as a way to create a more cohesive base for the mockups. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WMeoch288DEVpssy_QNtjooyKTLYa4qf" target="_blank">[User Flows]</a></p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The sitemap was based on the flows, condensing the actions into pages and links. The troubles with this were similar to those with the user flows, in that the file itself became so large it was difficult to navigate without breaking it down into smaller files and sections. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cRumJci_i5l-PJAQp-6_pfu9I5EgnqAW" target="_blank">[Sitemap]</a></p>

        <p class="animated nowHidden">Changes between iterations arose after testing and retesting with users through preference tests and small prototyping tests using Maze. Preference tests revealed more common UI patterns that users preferred for navigation, leading to less confusion about where they would click to get to where they wanted to go. The use of color in the hifi mockups also cleared up some usability confusion for testers since the way they were trying to navigate the page was by color and contrast, these being indicators for important information, what they can click, etc.</p>

In person testing revealed some other potential issues that led to more redesigning as well, eliminating unnecessary content for the user. This included getting rid of the language filter settings from the book recommendation settings page, as well as reworking the informational hierarchy of the account settings page. Every time a change was done or considered, either a preference test or a maze was launched to test the solution out.</p>

        <p class="animated nowHidden">The results showed that users often went to the image of a book to find the information on it. Making the touch target for the book view the entire area of the cover, title, author and description allowed users to easily navigate to where they wanted to go. Other things the testing revealed was the need for a home button on pages like the book view, author view and user view, otherwise users had trouble navigating back. Touch targets were initially a problem, as I was doing prototyping using the Sketch App prototype and Maze had trouble integrating all of the hotspots. It also made the touch targets the exact dimensions of the content within, meaning the text of a link was the touch target, so small that users had trouble accessing it. To fix this, I went back into the Sketch prototype and created padding areas that acted as the touch target of the content within. The padding for each of these areas was always 10px on each side of the content within.

        <p class="animated nowHidden">I created a style guide and branding that reflected both a playful and serious mood, at once colorful and toned down enough to not stress any users out. (Red was out as it often, for the age group I was targeting, called back to wrong answers on tests in school and caused anxiety upon sight.) Colors chosen were, for a primary highlight, , secondary highlight as  and rating color as . The background, as an off white, was selected as , so small an incremental change that it seems like it wouldn’t matter, but a preference test showed users gravitated more towards this than a pure white. The type was set to , a very dark grey, not quite as harsh as pure black and still easy to see and read.</p>

        <p class="animated nowHidden">For most of the app, Lato would be used as a base font, the weight and size changing based on the information importance. The brand typeface would be set as Playfair Display Black, a thick serif font that stands out as a header on any page. Buttons and section headers, I decided to use Montserrat because of the even spacing and sizing of the letters when fully capitalized. All of this lended a clean air to the work.</p>

        <h3 class="animated nowHidden">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="animated nowHidden"><b><i>The biggest takeaway from this project was just how important continual testing throughout refinement really was. A combination of prototype testing, preference testing, and refinement eliminated most usability issues and allowed for a more intuitive product for the user.</i></b></p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">The general idea of the product worked, as users were happy to try it out and found that the idea behind it was something they felt was useful. What didn’t work at first was the integration of these different features into one cohesive product. Finding ways to make sections within the app that weren’t so far apart was a little challenging, but with testing I was able to resolve them.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">I had some doubts about how I could make the search function make sense without overloading the user with choices, but it seemed alright. Perhaps a little small for some, but enlarging the type fixes that easily, as well as some more white space between content. What surprised me was the way users got to an end goal at times, finding indirect paths I wasn’t expecting, but that worked regardless. It was good to see new, innovative ways to navigate that I hadn’t anticipated beforehand, allowing me to create changes that allowed those new paths to flourish.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">If given more time, I would do more in person testing, a lot more. The information was invaluable, especially when combined with the remote testing afterwards. What I learned was how touch targets are important to calculate in a product, particularly if you aren’t deploying the product using invision. Other prototyping tools, like the Sketch App, require you to manually create a space for the touch target.</p>
        <p class="animated nowHidden">In the future, I’ll use that information to create more intuitive and interactive prototypes to allow users to generate even more useful usability information to make the application better.</p>
